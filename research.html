                <p>When you enter a URL in a browser:<br>
                   1. The browser parses the URL to extract details like the protocol and domain.<br>
                   2. It resolves the domain to an IP address using DNS.<br>
                   3. A TCP connection is established with the server.<br>
                   4. An HTTP(S) request is sent to the server, specifying the desired resource.<br>
                   5. The server processes the request and sends back an HTTP(S) response with the requested resource.<br>
                   6. The browser renders the HTML content, fetches additional resources, and displays the fully rendered webpage to the user.</p>
                <h2>Client/Server Infrastructure</h2>
                <p>Client/server infrastructure divides computing tasks between clients (end-user devices or applications) and servers (powerful systems). Clients initiate requests, while servers respond by providing services or resources. This architecture enables efficient communication and scalability in various computing environments.</p>
                <h2>Buzzwords</h2>
